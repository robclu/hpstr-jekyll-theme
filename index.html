        I am a final year PhD Student in the <a href="https://www.lsc.phy.cam.ac.uk/">Laboratory for Scientific Computing</a> at the University of Cambrige, supervised by <a href="https://www.lsc.phy.cam.ac.uk/directory/blakely">Dr Philip Blakely</a> and <a href="https://www.lsc.phy.cam.ac.uk/directory/nikiforakis">Prof Nikos Nikiforakis</a>.
        <br></br>
        My research interests are primarily in distributed computing, particularly the application of challenging problems to multi-gpu systems. My recent reseach has involved developing a framwork which makes large-scale multi-gpu programming accessible with minimal GPU knowledge, <a href="https://github.com/robclu/ripple">see ripple</a>, and using it to solve difficult real-world problems in fluid and solid dynamics which require massive computational resources.
        <br></br>
        I have been using C++ and CUDA for the past 7 years, and enjoy optimising applications, both for multi-threaded CPUs and especially for GPUs. I am also interested in machine learning, both in keeping up with the latest research, as well as in exploring existing frameworks such as PyTorch and Tensorflow to understand how they work and potentially contirubute in the future.
        <br></br>
        The work I most enjoy is at the interection of research and application,
        partitcularly involving GPUs, and am interested in any such job
        opportunities.
        <br></br>
        Outside of my work, I enjoy reading, playing golf, and triathlon. I am originally from South Africa, but have been in the UK for the past 4 years.
