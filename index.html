        I am a final year PhD Student in the <a class="teal-text" href="https://www.lsc.phy.cam.ac.uk/">Laboratory for Scientific Computing</a> at the University of Cambridge, supervised by <a class="teal-text" href="https://www.lsc.phy.cam.ac.uk/directory/blakely">Dr Philip Blakely</a> and <a class="teal-text" href="https://www.lsc.phy.cam.ac.uk/directory/nikiforakis">Prof Nikos Nikiforakis</a>.
        <br></br>
        My research interests are primarily in distributed computing, particularly the application of challenging problems to multi-gpu systems. My recent research has involved developing a framework which makes large-scale multi-gpu programming accessible with minimal GPU knowledge, <a class="teal-text" href="https://github.com/robclu/ripple">see ripple</a>, and using it to solve difficult real-world problems in fluid and solid dynamics which require massive computational resources.
        <br></br>
        I have been using C++ and CUDA for the past 7 years, and enjoy optimising applications, both for multi-threaded CPUs and especially for GPUs. I am also interested in machine learning, both in keeping up with the latest research, as well as in exploring existing frameworks such as PyTorch and Tensorflow to understand how they work and potentially contribute in the future.
        <br></br>
        The work I most enjoy is at the intersection of research and application,
        particularly involving GPUs, and am interested in any such job
        opportunities.
        <br></br>
        Outside of my work, I enjoy reading, playing golf, and triathlon. I am originally from South Africa, but have been in the UK for the past 4 years.

              <br>
              I have developed a general purpose compute framework which allows parallel programs with flexible data layout (AoS/SoA) to be executed on many-gpu systems with minimal knowledge of distributed programming or GPUs, and without performance compromise.
              I have used the framework to solve large multi-material interaction problems in computational fluid and solid dynamics on many GPUs, which has not previously been done.

              I rewrote in-house packet generation software to allow configurable bursty traffic patterns, of up to 100Gbps, using a multi-threaded approach with a custom memory allocator. This resulted in improved performance by up to 60% over the previous version, allowing in-house servers to be used for packet generation.

              I patched an open source packet generation engine to support Netronome’s network card drivers and in-house traffic pattern generator, allowing the performance of the network cards to be tested using open source software.

              <p>
                Ripple is a framework for large-scale heterogeneous compute, with a focus on multi-gpu systems. It requires minimal knowledge of parallel, distributed, or gpu programming, and will allow simple c++ code to scale to large systems.
                <br><br>
                It also supports polymorphic data layout, which allows user-defined classes to be stored as SoA or AoS, significantly
                improving performance on the GPU.
                <br><br>
                It scales very well, having been used to scale real-world computational fluid dynamics up to 7.3x on an 8 GPU system.

              <p>
                Fracture is library to perform large-scale simulations of multiple interacting materials, such as between fluids, gasses,
                and solids, using finite volume methods. It is currently a work in progress, however, simulations of high impact shock waves on air and helium bubbles and underwater explosions are examples of simulations which have been performed correctly.
                <br><br>
                On multi-gpu systems, it can be used to simulate 3D interactions in domains consisting of billions of cells in real-time. Support is currently being added for internal solid dynamics such as stress, strain, fracture, and void.

                A C++ library machine learning library built on PyTorch for fast inference of common object-detection and pose-estimation model. It is very much a work in progress, and used as a personal playground for implementing machine learning algorithms for understanding.
                <br><br>
                I intend to add models as I come across them and as I get time, and test the benefits for inference and training time when using the c++ PyTorch interface with custom CUDA implementations.

                Snowflake is a rendering engine written in Vulkan. It has mostly been used to learn about Vulkan and entity component systems. It is not very complete at this stage, but I hope to extend the current functionality to allow for real-time rendering of the simulations for fracture, as I have found existing solutions for rendering large-scale simulation data limiting.
